# apollo-swift

In order to get up and running with this project on your local machine, clone or download the git respository to your computer.

This project relies on a couple cocaopods, so open up terminal and type "sudo gem install cocoapods" and then "sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin cocoapods".
Next, run "pod setup" and then cd to the project folder and run "pod install" and you should be good to go! When opening the apollo app in xcode, be sure to always open "apollo.xcworkspace" or else the project will not be able to find its dependencies.
